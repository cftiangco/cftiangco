I have extensive experience working in various tech industries, including healthcare, education, and financial technology. Throughout my career, I have utilized a wide range of technologies and programming languagesâ€”such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, PHP, and Python to develop high-performance, scalable software and mobile applications.

In addition to my development skills, I am deeply interested in DevOps practices and tools. I enjoy automating workflows using technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, ArgoCD, and other tools related to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
